Input File formatting
#####################


Format for the fasta input file:
::

    >Short name|Full name
    sequence nucleotides (actg)

While the above formatting is standard for a fasta file, it helps with the output of PuMA. Short name is the abbreviation or accession number you want for output files (e.g. HPV16).
Full name is what will be printed to the screen (e.g. Human papillomavirus 16).

PuMA can annotate multiple genomes from the same fasta input file. Follow the above formatting for each sequence.
